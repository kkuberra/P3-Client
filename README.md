## Frisbee Golf HQ
This is a full stack application built with React, JavaScript, html
and CSS. The backend was built with Node.JS, PSQL, Express,
Knex.JS and Heroku. Frisbee Golf HQ works with the Google Maps
API that shows you course locations, information about each course
and a form to leave and delete comments for each course.
